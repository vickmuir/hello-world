Storage - Clarify how to recover VM info when NetApp storage node fails 

Storage - clarify how to migrate to a new NetApp volume when current volume is full 



Phase 1 

- ACS > Compute L3/Storage L3 (via IMS ticketing, business as usual)
- Mark Ball's Cloud support team

Define What scenarios to escalate to Storage 
 - what to check and what information to collect before escalating


Phase 2

- new SRE resources will get involved

- new API layer > IMS > NetApp


Datapath visibility is constricted to the tribe who manages the piece, so Storage sees the NetApp devices, while Networking sees the network devices. 

GC Compute team would ping the network team and compute team.

Generically,
- if you see a wide-scale issue, multiple VMs are affected 
- performance issue, compute first, Storage data path second.
- 

Single controller 95% -> degradation
It's very rare for us to get to that point.
When a system crosses threshold, Storage initiate an extension, so capacity is not going to cause an issue.

Link saturation, flapping interfaces can cause issues.

Single DC, wide scale performance issue - networking and storage at the same time.

- which DC, what VM, which storage array is it on


- GC compute - how to tell which storage a VM is on

Outages - CIE in Service Now

Tickets - in IMS.

Performance issue
